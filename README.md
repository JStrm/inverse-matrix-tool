# Inverse matrix tool

This program is a homework assignment for LAL2. The point of it is to find the inverse matrix.
I have written the assignment in Rust to learn the language. This is my first rust project.

The inputs can only be integers, so the program uses rational numbers (fractions) to handle the calculations.
This way, floating point errors can't occur and the result should be perfectly accurate.
